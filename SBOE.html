Culturally responsive and socially inclusive supports must be provided for English Language Learners.

                  <p class="margin-bottom-30">The State Board of Education (State Board) should direct the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) to build and maintain a robust and functional statewide longitudinal data system with automated data retrieval directly from LEAs. OSSE should use this system to assess what programs, curricula, interventions, etc. are working, and for whom, and which are not. The goal of this effort should be systemwide improvement by equipping schools and teachers with the insights, guidance, and supports they need to meet the needs of every student. Schools should share and collaborate to replicate the programs and interventions that data show to be successful and modify those that the data show are not effective.</p>

                  <p class="margin-bottom-30">In 2019, only 30 percent of DC fourth graders scored as proficient or better according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress reading assessments. The good news is that there is now broad agreement on how to teach literacy so that nearly all students will learn to read. Thanks to tireless and heroic advocacy led by Decoding Dyslexia DC, culminating in passage of the Addressing Dyslexia and Other Reading Difficulties Act of 2020, every DC local education agency is required to adopt a curriculum rooted in the science of reading. Now it falls to OSSE to see that every school has the resources and materials they need and that teachers and literacy coaches are supported with in-depth, compensated training. OSSE must fully and swiftly implement the recommentations of the Literacy Task Force.</p>

                  <p class="margin-bottom-30">The State Board should build on its work to collect and understand data related to teacher retention. The pandemic has worsened the District’s high rate of teacher turnover and principal turnover as school staff have been stretched thin taking on COVID-related duties, covering for absences, and teaching in new and varied virtual, hybrid, and other COVID-shaped circumstances. The State Board should explore and elevate strategies to support and retain teachers that invest in their growth and wellbeing, particularly those identified by teachers themselves.</p>
